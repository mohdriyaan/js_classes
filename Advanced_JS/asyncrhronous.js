// In Javascript , the synchronous or you can say simple operations are executed sequentially.

// Howewer real time applications makes calls to databases , apis and opening the files . 
// Here is where asynchronous operations comes into play.

// These tasks are not executed directly rather they give object called promise.

// A Promise Object represents the eventual completion or failure of asynchronous operation and gives the result.
// In JS if you request for information from remote api , it will make a promise whether the task will be completed or failed.
