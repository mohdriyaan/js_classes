<h1>Mongoose</h1>

Mongoose is a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data and provides a number of powerful features to help you interact with your data in MongoDB.

<h2>Installation</h2>

You can install Mongoose using npm:
```
npm install mongoose
```

<h2>Usage</h2>

To use Mongoose in your Node.js application, you first need to import it:
```
import mongoose from "mongoose"
```
Next, you need to connect to your MongoDB database:
```
mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@USERNAME-cluster.qbfd8ay.mongodb.net/DB_NAME");
```
Now you can define your data model using a schema:
```
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  email: String,
  password: String
});
```
Once you have defined your schema, you can create a model for it:
```
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
Now you can use the model to interact with your data in MongoDB:
```
const user = new User({
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 28,
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
});

user.save((err, user) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('User saved successfully!');
});
```
