1. NodeJS is an open source and cross runtime Javascript Runtime Enviroment

2. NodeJS runs on V8 Chromium Engine , the core engine of Google Chrome . This is why we can run Javascript prgrams outside the browser .

3. NodeJS runs on single process , without creating a thread for every single new request such as reading the data or acceesing it 
from the data base or the network . Instead it uses callback function . 

4. It uses event driven non blocking I/O model to handle concurrent requests by a single thread .
