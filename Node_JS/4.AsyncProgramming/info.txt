Synchronous Programming executes programs in sequential order . 

Sync Programming is also called blocking code because for ex while using apis if the response time from the server gets delayed
the execution gets blocked and after completing the code will go to the next code . This leads to bad user experience 

Javascript runtime enviroment consists of 2 parts : heap and call stack . All the memory allocations are stored in heap and the call stack
is a single thread where all the execution happens .

To overcome this we are using Asynchronous Programming.

Javascript is a single threaded synchronous programming language but it can handle async tasks using call back functions .
